# Welcome to PetApp

This app allows you to create, read, update, or delete a pet of your choice. 
The storage is in-memory and will not persist between app runs.

## Assumptions and improvement points
1) The only field populated by user in `name`, `createdAt` and `id` are auto-generated by the service
2) `createdAt` is a ZonedDateTime
3) `name` is limited to 16 characters
4) `todo`s in code represent points for future improvement
5) Future.successful wrapper in PetService imitates an async response from a DB
6) `name` is not unique, there might be many pets with the same name
7) Malformed UUID in GET request returns 405, need to handle this scenario more gracefully

## API

See [Swagger](Swagger.yaml) for detailed API documentation.

## Requirements

The project is written in Scala 2.13. I recommend using  [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/) or higher.

The build system is SBT - I am using the latest version, currently 1.9.9.

I use Akka HTTP in this implementation.

## Test

```console
$ sbt test
```

## Run

```console
$ sbt run
```

The application starts on `localhost:8080` by default.

## Improvements for production

1) Deployment - can be deployed with [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/)
2) For storage, a simple SQL solution with `petId` as primary key is sufficient
3) Implement authorisation with JWT in auth headers
4) Store secrets in an external key-vault
